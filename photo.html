It is easy because its technical rudiments can readily be mastered by anyone with a few simple instructions. It is difficult because, while the artist working in any other medium begins with a blank surface and gradually brings his conception into being, the photographer is the only imagemaker who begins with the picture completed. His emotions, his knowledge, and his native talent are brought into focus and fixed beyond recall the moment the shutter of his camera has closed.”</i>

                          Some say he’s the spiritual father of fine art photography. 
                          Founded Camera Work, a quarterly journal, considered to be 
                          the best and most beautiful photo magazine ever made. 
                          Created a series of photos that only depicted clouds without 
                          any other reference points, called Equivalents, which can be 
                          seen as the start of fine-art in photography. Later on, Minor 
                          White wrote a famous essay on Equivalents, explaining Stieglitz’ 
                          concepts behind Equivalents. The clouds as subject matter 
                          didn’t matter, it was the feeling conveyed and the symbolism 
                          that mattered. Stieglitz was also a friend of Steichen and 
                          co-founder of the Photo-Secession, a movement that promoted fine
                          art photography. Creator of iconic photographs like the Steerage,

                            Street photographer, photo-essayist, co-founder of Magnum photography. H-C B coined “The Decisive moment” to reflect that there’s a unique moment in photography when everything falls into place for the perfect composition to express a meaningful message. It’s highly intuitive and it cannot be repeated. Bresson was a master at that and created many iconic photographs that expressed this “Decisive moment’ and hereby elevating street or candid photography to an art form. Many street photographers after him have tried to capture the Decisive moment photograph, but only a few succeeded. One of them who should be mentioned is Andre Kertesz from whom Bresson gained inspiration. Kertesz called his Decisive Moment, “The delayed snapshot”.

                            Arguably one of the best known American photographers. The way we perceive and assess a black and white photograph up to this day, is largely formed by Ansel Adams’ contributions for elevating black and white photography to an art form. The term zone system was invented by him and he described how a good black and white should look like: good coverage of all tonal zones and a result of perceiving a scene in his mind’s eyes: visualization. His knowledge and teachings are documented in a 3 Volume book called “The Camera”, “The Negative” and “The Print”, which is considered to be the best text book on (black and white) photography ever written and largely still apply to modern day’s digital photography. Adams was also known for manipulating his images in the dark room to align it with his vision, his ‘pre-visualization’, rather than to accept the original negative as it is. Look at the video to get an impression of Adams’ post processing in the darkroom and how much he manipulated his images and how his famous photograph “Moon over Hernandez” looked like in a straight print without any manipulation.

                            War photographer, photo-essayist, co-founder of Magnum. His most famous, and at the same time a disturbing and iconic photograph, is a photo of the Spanish Civil war that depicts a man at the moment he’s being shot to death, called The Falling Soldier. The term Generation X was coined by Capa, who used it as a title for a photo-essay. During the first Indochina war, while being commissioned for a photo reportage of that war, he stepped on a landmine and became one of the casualties of one of the wars he documented so successfully.

                              One of the greatest portrait and editorial photographers of the past century who made many famous portraits of equally famous people. From Muhammed Ali and Kennedy to Churchill, Bogart and Hepburn: they were all iconized in front of Karsh’ camera. Karsh was known to give significant importance to the hands of his subjects, as any good portrait photographer would do, and he would lit their hands separately. Many of his photographs are familiar to many people even though they might not know the artist behind it.

                            Edward is regarded as one of the great American photographers who mastered the landscape, the portrait and the still life photograph. Especially known for his famous photographs of a pepper that many photography students still try to emulate. What not many people know is that Weston described the concept of pre-visualization at least ten years earlier than Ansel Adams who made this a term that every photographer today knows about. Together with Ansel Adams he was part of a group of San Francisco photographers called Group f/64 who emphasized the precisely focused and correctly exposed subject.

                            Environmental portrait photographer. Arnold Newman took the art of portraiture to another level by trying to include the natural habitat of his subjects in his photographs. Newman did that in a way that also gives an indication of the profession and passions of his subjects. Many times he framed his subjects, very often other famous artists like painters, musicians and architects, in such a way that they became part of their own artistic creations. Newman kept records of his photography sessions in so called ‘sitting books’ in which he would record details of that session.  The two pages below depict the sessions with composer Igor Stravinsky for probably his most famous environmental portrait photograph.

                            When we’re talking about documentary photography an extensive list of photographers come to mind but Dorothea Lange surely was one of the most prolific in this genre. She received a lot of recognition with her series of photos of migrant families. She documented the consequences the Great Depression had on displaced farm families, commissioned by the Farm Security Administration  When looking at her most famous photograph Migrant Mother, it reminds me, despite the obvious lack of colour, so much of Steve McCurry’s Afghan Woman. I’d say, that Migrant Mother is the Mother of this Afghan woman on more than one level.

Over a period of time the world changes; rivers flow, planes fly by, clouds pass and the earth’s position relative to the stars is different. This accumulation of time and events, impossible for the human eye to take in, can be recorded on film. For the photographer, real can become surreal, which is exciting. During the day, when most photographs are made, scenes are usually viewed from the vantage-point of a fixed single light source, the sun. At night the light can come from unusual and multiple sources. There can be deep shadows which act as catalysts for our imagination. There is often a sense of drama, a story about to be told, secrets revealed, actors about to enter onto the stage. The night has vast potential for creativity.”</i>

                              Long exposure black and white minimalistic photography is quite a popular genre the last years and is still gaining in popularity. But despite the long list of great long exposure photographers of late it all started with Michael Kenna. Perhaps not the first long exposure photographer – who can tell? – but surely the photographer who was at the start of long exposure photography as a very popular genre. Kenna’s long exposure photographs are often times focused on night time long exposure photography with exposure times extending to 5 hours or more, of course using analog cameras. But besides the typical long exposure photographs with mainly seascapes and a famous series with nuclear power plants, called Power Station, Kenna also created a breathtaking series of lone trees in the snow. Michael Kenna, truly an artist who had a decisive influence on today’s photography.

                            Ms. Vivian Maier shared the fate of many famous artists and gained popularity only after she died. Her way as a famous film photographer started in 2007 at an auction when John Maloof bought a case of negatives and undeveloped film. At that time no one knew that it was a real treasure. Vivian dedicated her life to kids and worked as a nanny. She shot at any occasion on the twin lens 6×6 camera that she carried everywhere. She captured everything that attracted her attention while she was walking around. Mostly, she photographed Chicago and New York.
                            <br><br>
                            Vivian gained the title of one of the most prominent black and white film photography artists. People who knew her thought that she was aloof and weird, but her images express deep insight and the individual stories of strangers standing in front of her viewfinder. I can only imagine what people felt when they noticed an unfamiliar woman staring at them with camera in hands in the middle of Chicago, but her passion for creating a film photo resulted in accurate and excellent photographs. Another amazing thing about her pictures is the time travel effect. While they resemble 1940's or even 1930's, most of them are taken much closer to our days. Spend some time and examine her works in detail.

                            Annie Leibovitz is a modern famous film photographer and you’ve probably seen some of her work. She was lucky enough to start her career with Rolling Stone magazine and she worked there for 10 years before sending her photographs to other magazines. Lately, she's been cooperating a lot with Vanity Fair magazine. Leibovitz took film photography portraits of nearly every celebrity. Her love for the film portraits in combination with distinguished lighting style make her one of the best film photographers in the world. Annie uses filling and volumetric light setup that produces a soft, nearly painterly picture. I bet you would easily be able to distinguish her photographs after you study her original method, as her mastery as a film photographer is truly inimitable.

                            If you are inspired by her method, start with the studio lighting. Don’t be afraid to experiment, as it’s the best way to achieve a really great film photo. Actually, you can start with no-branded speed lightning systems from Amazon. The quality they offer is quite similar to the high-end professional equipment so there is no need to spend more like a newbie. It’s better to invest in practice.
